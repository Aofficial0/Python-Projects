This Python script allows players to play the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors against the computer. Here's how the game works:
<br>
<h3>How to Play</h3>
<br>
Run the script in a Python environment.<br>
Input your choice by typing the corresponding number:<br>
Type 0 for Rock<br>
Type 1 for Paper<br>
Type 2 for Scissors<br>
The computer randomly selects its choice.<br>
The winner is determined based on the rules:<br>
Rock beats Scissors<br>
Paper beats Rock<br>
Scissors beats Paper<br>
The result is displayed in the terminal.<br>
<h3>Game Logic</h3>

The game uses a list of ASCII art representations for Rock, Paper, and Scissors to visually represent the choices.<br>
User input is captured using the input() function, allowing players to choose their move.<br>
The computer's choice is generated randomly using the random.randint() function.<br>
The game determines the winner based on the rules of Rock Paper Scissors and displays the result.<br>
<br>
<h3>Code Explanation</h3>
<br>
The game is written in Python and utilizes basic control structures such as conditionals (if, elif, else) and loops.<br>
ASCII art is used to enhance the visual experience and display the game's elements.<br>
The random module is imported to generate the computer's choice randomly.<br>
User input is validated to ensure it falls within the acceptable range (0, 1, or 2) representing Rock, Paper, or Scissors.<br>
The game compares the user's choice with the computer's choice to determine the winner.<br>
The result is displayed in the terminal, indicating whether the player wins, loses, or it's a draw.<br>
