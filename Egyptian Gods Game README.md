<h1>Egyptian Gods Game</h1>
<br>
This Python script is an interactive text-based game where the player takes on the role of a character exploring an Egyptian temple. The goal is to make choices that lead to a successful outcome while avoiding traps and hazards. Here's how the game works:
<br>
<h3>How to Play</h3>
Run the script in a Python environment.<br>
Follow the prompts displayed in the terminal.<br>
Make choices by typing 'Yes' or 'No', or other specified options.<br>
Navigate through the temple, encountering different scenarios.<br>
Reach the end of the game by making the right choices to win, or face consequences leading to defeat.<br>
<br>
<h3>Game Flow</h3>
Starting Point: The player encounters a temple in the Egyptian desert.<br>
Decision Point 1: Choose whether to enter the temple or not.<br>
Decision Point 2: Inside the temple, choose between two tombs, red or blue.<br>
Result 1: If the red tomb is chosen, the player may find the Goddess Isis.<br>
Decision Point 3: After encountering Isis, choose between two treasure boxes, gold or silver.<br>
Result 2: Depending on the choice, the player gains powers or faces consequences.<br>
Game Over: Wrong choices lead to defeat by either Anubis or Amun-Ra.<br>
Victory: Choosing wisely leads to victory, such as gaining the power of the moon.<br>
<br>
<h3>Code Explanation</h3>
The game is written in Python and uses the print() function to display text-based graphics and messages.<br>
User input is captured using the input() function, allowing players to make choices.<br>
Conditional statements (if, else) are used to determine the flow of the game based on the player's choices.<br>
The game logic is structured using nested conditional statements, creating branching paths.<br>
ASCII art is used to enhance the visual experience and depict characters and scenes within the game.<br>
